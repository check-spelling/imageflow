## deployment

Cd into this directory and run

```bash
helm install $deploymentname ./ --namespace $namespacename
```

### Test deployment

Generate a readable output without deploying

```bash
helm install $deploymentname ./ --namespace $namespacename --dry-run
```

### Upgrade deployment

Upgrade existing deployment

```bash
helm upgrade --install $deploymentname ./ --namespace $namespacename --dry-run
```

## Container Startup arguments.

The Values.yaml file supports an array of startup arguments. When you are ready to mount containers you can add the settings to the "startupArgs:" in the values file.

```
startupArgs: [
    "sudo chown -R imageflow /home/imageflow/; /home/imageflow/imageflow_server start \
    --bind-address 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 3000 \
    --demo \
    --data-dir /home/imageflow/data/",
  ]
```

## Ingress

This chart comes with ingress support out of the box. For ingress to work you do need to have an ingress controller installed on your cluster. The example uses an Nginx ingress with TLS, but by changing the annotations you can change this to another installed ingress controller. Ingress settings are located in Values.yaml

## live and readiness probes.

Inside of the values.yaml you are able to switch on or off the monitoring of the container, these settings are used to avoid stuck containers from traffic being routed to them. When disabled, the container will always keep running.
