### Contributing code - legally

We reserve the right to relicense this software (or portions thereof) in order to ensure its sustainability. To make this possible, we have [a Contributor Agreement](http://imageresizing.net/licenses/contribute) lifted from the Apache foundation.

Small commits can simply include this statement: 

        I release these contributions under the terms of the Imazen Contributor Agreement V1.0 
        (http://imageresizing.net/licenses/contribute), the terms of which I accept and agree.
        - [Name] [Date]

Frequent or heavy committers should [sign and date the actual agreement](http://imageresizing.net/licenses/contribute), which only needs to be done once. Digital signatures or scanned copies are accepted; send them to support@imageresizing.net. 

If you are introducing any new dependencies, those licenses may obligate you to create a notice.txt or license.txt file.
